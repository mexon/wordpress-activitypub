# Life Cycle of a Pull Request

When you’re first starting out, your natural instinct when creating a new feature will be to create a local feature branch, and start building away. If you start doing this, *stop*, take your hands off the keyboard, grab a coffee and read on. :)

**It’s important to break your feature down into small pieces first**, each piece should become its own pull request.
