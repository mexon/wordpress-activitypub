# Contributing to ActivityPub for WordPress

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

Developers of all levels can help — whether you can barely recognize a filter (or don’t know what that means) or you’ve already authored your own plugins, there are ways for you to pitch in.

## Create Bug Reports

If you find a bug, please [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-activitypub/issues/). If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

If you’re filing a bug, specific steps to reproduce are helpful. Please include the URL of the page that has the bug, along with what you expected to see and what happened instead.

## Write and submit a patch

If you'd like to fix a bug or make an enhancement, you can submit a Pull Request. Before you get started, you'll want to **[set up your development environment.](docs/development-environment.md)**

Once your development environment is ready, you can get started and [create your first Pull Request!](docs/pull-request.md)

### Get started

If you'd like to contribute but don't know where to get started, you can take a look at existing issues:

- ["Good First Issues"](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-activitypub/labels/%5BType%5D%20Good%20First%20Issue) are a good entry point to get familiar with ActivityPub plugin's code base.
- All issues labeled with [the "Good For Community" label](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-activitypub/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Good+For+Community%22) are fair game. That's a great way to contribute new features and fix small issues within the ActivityPub plugin.

### We’re Here To Help

We encourage you to ask for help at any point. We want your first experience with the ActivityPub plugin to be a good one, so don’t be shy. If you’re wondering why something is the way it is, or how a decision was made, please create an issue and prefix it with “Question:”.

## Translate the plugin

If you speak a foreign language, you can help translate the ActivityPub plugin into your own language. [here is how.](docs/translations)

## License

The ActivityPub plugin is licensed under the [MIT](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-activitypub/blob/trunk/LICENSE) license.

If you are contributing code that is not your own, such as adding a component from another Open Source project, or adding an `npm` package, you need to make sure you follow these steps:

1. Check that the code has a license. If you can't find one, you can try to contact the original author and get permission to use, or ask them to release under a compatible Open Source license.
2. Check the license is compatible with MIT and [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses), note that the Apache 2.0 license is *not* compatible.
